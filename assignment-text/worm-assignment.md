Worm Assignment Overview
==================================================

Your assignment will be to create a distributed program that stays alive
in the face of failures.
This program will be in the form of a _worm_.

Background: What is a Worm?
--------------------------------------------------

Computer worms are a self-replicating computer program,
similar to a computer virus.
The distinction is that while a virus runs by writing its code into a host program,
changing its behavior,
a worm is more independent:
it enters a system via the network, runs as its own process,
and propagates from there.

Worms are typically malware and are rarely thought of as useful.
However, the worm concept started as an early and influential experiment in
distributed computing.

Computer worms were first described in a 1982 paper
by John F. Shoch and Jon A. Hupp\ [-@shoch1982Worm]
at the renowned Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
In Shoch and Hupp's conception,
a worm is a group of cooperating processes, called _segments_,
that propagate copies of themselves across a local network
and then work together to perform some useful function.
By replicating and propagating,
the worm as a whole can stay alive
even if some segments or network nodes fail.
They experimented with several uses for worms,
including acting as an uncrashable alarm clock,
displaying a "cartoon of the day,"
and running network diagnostics.

In this assignment, you will be building what Shoch and Hupp called
"the existential worm,"
a worm with no payload (no alarm clock or cartoon),
simply a worm for its own sake.
Your worm will propagate to different nodes in our compute cluster
and cooperate to keep itself both alive and under control.

The Worm Gate
--------------------------------------------------

To propagate, a worm needs some way to enter a computer and start running.
A malicious worm takes advantage of security holes in operating systems
and applications to "worm" its way into a system and trick the system
into starting the segment program.
In Shoch and Hupp's case,
their benevolent worms were deliberately allowed into the
system via their lab's network-boot infrastructure.

For this assignment,
we will provide a deliberate security hole in the form of an HTTP
server that simply accepts code from the internet and runs it.
We call this spectacularly unsafe program the _worm gate_.
Our worm gate will have a simple HTTP API that allows you to upload
an executable to run and also to kill any processes that the gate has started.
See the worm gate's README file for details.

You will run this worm gate code on different nodes on the cluster,
and write a worm that uses it to propagate.

Assignment Requirements
==================================================

You should continue to work in your groups
from the presentations and assignment\ 1.

Your hand-in will include source code and a report.
You will also participate in an informal demo session like with
the assignments in INF-3200 last semester.

Worm Operation
--------------------------------------------------

You will start the provided worm gate server on multiple nodes in the cluster,
then you will run your worm via those worm gates.
For a refresher on the cluster and how to access it,
see the [cluster intro][cluster_intro]
and [paper access/VPN][paper_access]
documents on Canvas.
Remember that you can run multiple worm gates per node by varying the
port numbers.

Your worm will use the worm-gate's upload mechanism to spread from node
to node to grow to a target size.
If your worm is not at its target size,
it must either grow or shrink to the target size.

The worm gate can and will kill your worm segments.
The worm should notice that a segment is down and launch a replacement.
It is also possible that a worm gate might stop cooperating
and start refusing requests to run worm code.

Having a well-behaved worm will require communication and coordination
between segments.
You may use any coordination strategy you choose.
You are encouraged to use a known consensus algorithm such as
Paxos\¬†[@lamport2001PaxosMadeSimple; @vanRenesse2015PaxosModeratelyComplex]
or Raft\ [@ongaro2014Raft]
for coordination.
However, a simpler algorithm will be accepted as long as it still results
in a well-behaved worm.

Your worm is not required to implement any particular API
(the demo will use the worm gate's API).
However, you will of course need to create some interface for
controlling your worm,
including
querying its status,
setting its target size,
and most importantly, telling it to shut down.

You may use pre-written libraries,
but be mindful that your worm segment
and any libraries it uses
must be bundled into a single executable
to get in through the worm gate.
Also be aware that pre-written libraries might not line up
perfectly with how you want to use them.
For example,
previous students have reported being drawn to the [PySyncObj] library,
only to find its API awkward to use for this task.

Worm Operating Requirements
--------------------------------------------------

Your worm must operate within the following constraints:

### The worm must maintain a consistent target size

The required experiments and the demo session will involve killing
segments and watching your worm recover.
The number of running worm segments must stay close to the target.
Some margin of error or delay is allowed, but the worm must
not grow out of control.

### The worm must propagate via the provided worm gate

You may not use SSH to start the worm program,
and you may not use the cluster's shared file system to
copy the program code or to communicate.
Imagine that the worm gate is a zero-day exploit that you
are taking advantage of.
All code must enter through the worm gate.

Be aware that this requires bundling your worm segment into
a single executable.
In particular,
if your worm segment is a Python script that relies on libraries
you installed with `pip --user`,
then it will be very likely to break during the demo
due to missing libraries.
To avoid that stressful situation,
see the `python_zip_example/` directory in the hand-out code for an example
of how to bundle an entire Python project into a single binary.

You may find that a compiled language is a better fit for this project.

### Worm state must be kept in RAM

The worm must not touch the disk.
You can _read_ from the disk.
In particular, your worm segment executable will most likely need to read
its own file in order to propagate.
But do not write to the disk.

### The worm must shut down when ordered to do so

Your worm must be a well-behaved worm.
Robert T. Morris may be a professor at MIT now\ [@morrisCsail]
(and one of the coauthors of the Chord paper\ [@chord]),
but he got in a lot of trouble as a grad student
in 1988 when a worm he created got out of
control and crippled the early internet\ [@morrisCase; @markoff1993ComputerIntruder; @orman2003MorrisWormFifteenYears].

Required Experiments
--------------------------------------------------

You must perform the following experiments to examine the behavior of your worm:

1.  **Time to grow from 1 to ùëõ segments,**
    for\ ùëõ\ =\ 2...20

    Your worm will naturally start as a single segment.
    It should then grow to its target size.
    You will record how long it takes to grow and stabilize
    from 1 to 2, then repeat from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, and so on,
    until you are growing from 1 to 20.

    How you perform the timing and how you determine that the worm is stable
    is up to you.

    You are also encouraged to experiment with larger worms,
    but trials up to 20 are required.

2.  **Time for worm of size ùëõ to recover from ùëò segments killed,**
    where\ ùëõ\ ‚â•\ 10\ and for\ ùëò\ =\ 1\ ...\ ùëõ-1

    Start with a worm of size ùëõ ‚â• 10 and send a command to one of the worm
    gates to kill the segment it is hosting.
    The worm should notice the missing segment and grow back to its target size.
    You will record how long this recovery takes.
    Repeat this experiment,
    increasing the number of segments killed
    until you are killing all but one segment.

    You may choose to perform this experiment with a larger worm,
    but 10 segments is the minimum starting size.

Your report should include plots with the results of each experiment,
as well as discussion of the results.

You should perform multiple trials (at least 3) for each independent
variable, and plot the data with error bars.

Note that fast times are not necessarily the goal here.
You will not be penalized for having a slow worm.
The goal is to increase your insights into quantitatively evaluating what you build.

Delivery
--------------------------------------------------

Your delivery must include source code and report.
You must also participate in a demo session similar to the assignments last semester.

Source and report must be bundled together in a zip file or tarball
and uploaded to Canvas before the demo session.
This means that the deadline is during the day, before class, not midnight.

### Source Code

Your source code must include a README file with instructions for running
the code on the cluster.

### Report

Your report should be in the form of a scientific paper and should include
background on worms, a description of your solution,
results of your experiments, and relevant discussion.

- Describe the design decisions you made and why you made them.
    How do your segments communicate?
    What coordination algorithms did you use?
    If you used a known algorithm, how did you build the worm around it?
    What libraries did you use? How did you incorporate them?
    etc.

- Describe your experiment methodology.
    How did you time the trials?
    How did you deterimine the worm was stable?
    etc.

- A typical report length for this assignment is 3--6 pages.
    If you are far outside of that range,
    consider what you are missing or what you can cut.

See the [how to write a report][how_to_write_a_report] document on Canvas
for a refresher on report format.

Demo
--------------------------------------------------

Like in INF-3200 last semester, you will be required to give an informal
demo where you briefly describe your solution and run your code on the
cluster.
No slides are necessary,
but be prepared to discuss your solution
and how it might differ from the solutions of other groups.
During the demo, Mike will be in control of the worm-gate servers that
will run your worm segment code, and they may include some surprises not
present in the code we hand out.

Have Fun!
--------------------------------------------------

This assignment is deliberately open-ended.
We provide the worm gate, and the rest is up to you.
That is the fun and the challenge of this assignment.

If you have questions, talk to Mike.
